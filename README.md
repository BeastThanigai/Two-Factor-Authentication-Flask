# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) System  
### Flask-Based Authentication Using Google Authenticator (TOTP)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** system using **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)** generated by **Google Authenticator** or similar authenticator apps.

The system enhances login security by requiring:
1. **Username (something the user knows)**  
2. **OTP from Authenticator App (something the user has)**  

A **QR code** is generated during registration, which users scan using Google Authenticator to start generating secure OTPs.

This project is developed using **Python Flask** and is intended for **cybersecurity learning**, **authentication concepts**, and **secure system design**.

## 🎯 Objective

- To understand and implement **Two-Factor Authentication**
- To learn how **TOTP (RFC 6238)** works
- To integrate **Google Authenticator** with a web application
- To generate and verify **QR-based OTP secrets**
- To demonstrate secure authentication concepts in practice

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers with a username  
2. System generates a **unique secret key**  
3. A **QR code** is generated and displayed  
4. User scans QR code using Google Authenticator  
5. Authenticator generates time-based OTP  
6. User enters OTP in the application  
7. System verifies OTP and grants access
